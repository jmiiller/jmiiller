## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Jeff! Welcome to my profile!

I am a Team Lead @ Paceline.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently building serverless, event-driven systems with **Terraform**, **TypeScript**, **AWS Lambda, API Gateway, Eventbridge, SQS, SNS, DynamoDB, and S3**. I also have experience building **Node.js/Express.js/GraphQL** APIs, **React** frontends, and deploying infrastructure with **Terraform**.

- âš¡ Fun fact: My last name has two i's and two l's. It is confusing! :)
