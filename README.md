## Hi there 👋, I'm Jeff! Welcome to my profile!

I am a Backend Software Engineer @ Paceline.

---

- 🔭 I’m currently building serverless, event-driven systems with **Terraform**, **TypeScript**, **AWS Lambda, API Gateway, Eventbridge, SQS, SNS, DynamoDB, and S3**. I also have experience building **Node.js/Express.js/GraphQL** APIs, **React** frontends, and deploying infrastructure with **Terraform**.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Route 53, ACM, and AWS Load Balancers.

- ⚡ Fun fact: My last name has two i's and two l's. It is confusing! :)
