## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Jeff! Welcome to my profile!

I am a Senior Software Engineer - Team Lead @ Replicon.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently building serverless, event-driven systems with **Terraform**, **TypeScript**, **AWS Lambda, SQS, SNS, DynamoDB, and S3**. I also have experience building **Node.js/Express.js/GraphQL** APIs, **React** frontends, and deploying infrastructure with **Terraform**.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Turborepo, pnpm, Monorepos (generally), and Github Actions.

- âš¡ Fun fact: My last name has two i's and two l's. It is confusing! :)
